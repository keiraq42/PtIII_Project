Commonly, the shock wave is tracked thanks to pressure sensors and sometimes with a high-speed camera. In the present study, these methods were used to analyze the interaction of a shock wave with an obstacle of simple geometry. The primary aim of the study was to demonstrate the need to correlate these different methods in order to analyze certain phenomena related to the three-dimensional interaction of a shock wave with an object. The correlation between the overpressure and the visualization made it possible to carry out a complex analysis. The visualization was carried out simultaneously on two planes, from the front and top views, thanks to the optical setup. Shock wave characteristics were taken at ground level downstream of the obstacle with pressure gauges. The correlation of the images obtained allows the identification of the waves on the profile and their contribution in intensity.},

	abstract = {The shock Hugoniot is a fundamental relationship between pressure, volume, and energy for a given medium. Accurate knowledge of the Hugoniot for a material is critical in order to determine its response to shock waves and high-velocity impacts. Traditionally, the shock Hugoniot is measured on a point-bypoint basis by a series of high-velocity impact experiments. Observations are typically conﬁned to pointwise pressure or velocity measurements at the free-surfaces of the sample. In this work, shock waves are initiated in transparent polyurethane and semi-opaque polyurea samples using exploding bridgewires, aluminum ballistic projectiles, and gram-scale explosive charges. Shock waves and material motion are observed optically by shadowgraphy using a high-speed-digital camera recording at up to 106 frames/s. Ballistic impact, producing a constant-strength shock wave, is combined with these optical techniques to obtain a single shock Hugoniot point per test. A gram-scale explosive charge produces a shock wave in the material sample that is initially strong, but attenuates to near the bulk sound speed as it transits the polymer sample. With optical access to the entire sample, multiple shock and particle velocity combinations may be observed in a single test, allowing the measurement of a shock Hugoniot curve in fewer experiments than by traditional methods. These techniques produce data in general agreement with an extrapolation of published Hugoniot data for polyurethane and polyurea.},

	abstract = {Brittle deformation at high strain rates results in intense fragmentation and rock pulverisation. For rocks, the critical strain rate at which this behaviour occurs is {\textasciitilde}102 s−1. The mechanical properties of rocks at these strain rates can also be very different from their quasi-static properties. Deformation of rocks at these strain rates can occur during fault rupture, landslide events, and meteorite impacts. In this study, we present the results of high strain rate mechanical tests to determine the characteristic strain rate for rate-dependent brittle failure, and the fragment size and shape distributions that result from failure at these conditions. We investigated sandstone, quartzite, limestone, and marble and considered whether the fragment characteristics can be used as diagnostic indicators of loading conditions during brittle failure. We find that the characteristic strain rates, where the dynamic strength is twice the quasi-static strength, range between {\textasciitilde}150 and 300 s−1 for rate-dependent brittle failure in the investigated lithologies. Furthermore, we use our results to demonstrate an empirical inverse power-law relationship between fragment size and strain rate for dynamic failure under uniaxial compression. On the other hand, we show that fragment shape is independent of strain rate under dynamic uniaxial loading.},

All run products that quenched to a glass were analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and found to contain ≤500 ppm H2O. In addition, new X-ray diffraction experiments on fully disordered albite are reported to 7.6 GPa; the Þ tted results lead to a zero-pressure bulk modulus (K0) of 56.4 ± 0.7 and a pressure derivative (K0') of 3.9 ± 0.3 in a third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. Revised values for the enthalpy and entropy of fusion of high albite at one bar and 1100 °C (∆HTf = 64.5 ± 2.1 kJ/mol and ∆STf = 47.0 J/(mol·K)) are recommended on the basis of improved heat capacity equations for NaAlSi3O8 glass and liquid. On the basis of these new results on the fusion curve and thermody- namic data for high albite, the pressure dependence of the NaAlSi3O8 liquid compressibility (K0') is constrained to be 10.8 ± 1.5 in a third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. The uncertainty in K0' of ±1.5 contributes an error to melt density at 3 GPa (2.543 ± 0.010 g/cm 3 at 1500 °C) of ±0.4\%.},

	abstract = {Protoplanets growing within the protoplanetary disk by pebble accretion acquire hydrostatic gas envelopes. Due to accretion heating, the temperature in these envelopes can become high enough to sublimate refractory minerals which are the major components of the accreted pebbles. Here we study the sublimation of different mineral species and determine whether sublimation plays a role during the growth by pebble accretion. For each snapshot in the growth process, we calculate the envelope structure and the sublimation temperature of a set of mineral species representing different levels of volatility. Sublimation lines are determined using an equilibrium scheme for the chemical reactions responsible for destruction and formation of the relevant minerals. We find that the envelope of the growing planet reaches temperatures high enough to sublimate all considered mineral species when {\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}textgreaterM{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater ≳ 0.4 {\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}textgreaterM{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlesssub{\textbackslash}textgreater⊕{\textbackslash}textlesssub/{\textbackslash}textgreater.

Our calculated values are in good agreement with the slightly depleted sulfur abundance of Mars, while the model over predicts the extensive sulfur depletion of Earth by a factor of approximately 2. We show that a collision with a sulfur-rich body akin to Mars in the moon-forming giant impact lifts the Earth’s sulfur abundance to approximately 10\% of the solar value for all impactor masses above 0.05 Earth masses.},

It should be noted that these properties of silica, first parameters of its critical point, are poorly known theoretically nowadays. At the same time experimental investigation of all these proprties of silica are very difficult and are poorly known also. So far as there is no experimental data on critical temperature and pressure for silica. This is why it is important to compare different theoretical predictions for high-temperature behaviour of all EOS for silica and especially existing predictions for critical point locations and properties, which are predicted by different theoretical models and semi-mpirical rules. Several such EOS have been selected among other. It is also important to compare these theoretical predictions with reconmmendations of handbooks and scarse experimental data from literature. This is just the subject of present paper.},

	abstract = {Rocky planets and moons experiencing solar wind sputtering are continuously supplying their enveloping exosphere with ejected neutral atoms. To understand the quantity and properties of the ejecta, well-established binary collision approximation Monte Carlo codes like TRIM with default settings are used predominantly. Improved models such as SDTrimSP have come forward, and together with new experimental data, the underlying assumptions have been challenged. We introduce a hybrid model, combining the previous surface binding approach with a new bulk binding model akin to Hofsäss \& Stegmaier. In addition, we expand the model implementation by distinguishing between free and bound components sourced from mineral compounds such as oxides or sulﬁdes. The use of oxides and sulﬁdes also enables the correct setting of the mass densities of minerals, which was previously limited to the manual setting of individual atomic densities of elements. All of the energies and densities used are thereby based on tabulated data, so that only minimal user input and no ﬁtting of parameters are required. We found unprecedented agreement between the newly implemented hybrid model and previously published sputter yields for incidence angles up to 45° from surface normal. Good agreement is found for the angular distribution of mass sputtered from enstatite MgSiO3 compared to the latest experimental data. Energy distributions recreate trends of experimental data of oxidized metals. Similar trends are to be expected from future mineral experimental data. The model thus serves its purpose of widespread applicability and ease of use for modelers of rocky body exospheres.},

	abstract = {The hydrothermal melting of KAlSi3O8 has been investigated from 1–28 kbar, using microcline and sanidine as starting materials. Both polymorphs melted at the same P-T conditions, and no metastable melting was observed; unlike albite, the inversion temperature from ordered to disordered structures is well below the P-T region of melting; thus sanidine cannot melt in the field of microcline, and microcline invariably inverts to sanidine before melting. The melting curve is drawn through points at 950 °C at 2 kbar, 900 °C at 4 kbar, 820 °C at 10 kbar, 800 °C at 12 kbar, 780 °C at 15 kbar, 765 °C at 18 kbar, and 700 °C at 28 kbar. A flattening of the dP/dT slope at higher pressures, although present, is less pronounced and occurs at higher pressures (\&gt;20 kbar) than that for albite (\&gt;14 kbar), and the effect of pressure on H2O solubility in the melt is less than for albite. The melting of KAlSi3O8 was reversed by two-step reversal experiments that consisted of melting microcline, followed by crystallization of sanidine from the quenched melt. Above 15 kbar coherent glass was not produced by quenching, but a granular incoherent brownish isotropic substance (GIBIS) was observed in the quench product. Abundant quenched vapor precipitate, not readily distinguished from quenched melt, was also observed in experiments above 15 kbar. Vapor solubility of potassium feldspar components is greater than that of albite components at these pressures, and the univariant nature of the melting curve may be lost at PH2O \&gt; 15 kbar because of incongruent solubility in the vapor phase. The lack of metastable melting of microcline suggests that disordering, as in the case of albite, always precedes melting. No incongruent melting to leucite was observed in experiments as low as 1.8 kbar, suggesting that metastability may have played a role in earlier low-pressure experimentation of others, and a field of leucite + liquid must exist only at lower H2O pressures than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Planetary Interiors Under Pressure The interiors of Earth and other rocky planets generally consist of a few common minerals. Depending largely on the size of the planet, the distribution and relative abundance of these minerals varies; for example, MgO is abundant in the mantles of Earth and large Earth-like planets, but is present in Jupiter's core. The properties of MgO also vary with planetary size as a function of temperature and pressure. McWilliams et al. (p. 1330 , published online 22 November) performed laser-shock experiments at pressures over three times higher than Earth's inner core. MgO underwent two phase transformations, first to a solid with a modified crystal structure, and then to a conductive liquid. In terrestrial planets greater than eight Earth masses, MgO in the mantle could generate a magnetic field–generating dynamo such as those that typically found in planetary cores. , Mantle minerals conductive at the high pressures and temperatures of planetary interiors could induce a magnetic field. , Magnesium oxide (MgO) is representative of the rocky materials comprising the mantles of terrestrial planets, such that its properties at high temperatures and pressures reflect the nature of planetary interiors. Shock-compression experiments on MgO to pressures of 1.4 terapascals (TPa) reveal a sequence of two phase transformations: from B1 (sodium chloride) to B2 (cesium chloride) crystal structures above 0.36 TPa, and from electrically insulating solid to metallic liquid above 0.60 TPa. The transitions exhibit large latent heats that are likely to affect the structure and evolution of super-Earths. Together with data on other oxide liquids, we conclude that magmas deep inside terrestrial planets can be electrically conductive, enabling magnetic field–producing dynamo action within oxide-rich regions and blurring the distinction between planetary mantles and cores.},

	abstract = {The decomposition temperature of schorl was found to be 880 ± 10°C using X-ray and optical methods. The main crystalline product in decomposed schorl and dravite was found to be a boron containing mullrte, the composition of this phase was found to become closer to that of mullite (3Al203.2Si02) as the decomposition temperature was increased. The size of these possibly slightly.orientated needle shaped microcrystals was approximately 25 ± 10 u by 3 ± 2 u by 3 ± 2 u. The main decompostion products obtained in reducing conditions, in addition to the boron containing mudite, were hercynite \{FeO-Al203\} at low temperatures and oC— iron at higher temperatures. The decomposition temperature:; of schorl in the presence of activated charcoal was found to be at least 60ˆC lower than that for air decomposed schorl. This decrease was thought to be associated wcth the formation of hercynite by a low temperature reaction between schorl and activated charcoal. The boric oxide and Iron oxide in air decomposed schorl were both extracted by dilute acid. The rate of extraction was found to increase as the original schorl decomposition temperature was increased. The activation energy for the extraction of boric oxide as a function of the schorl decomposition temperature was found to be equal to 19.2 ± 0.4 kcal/mole. This increase in the rate of extraction of boric oxide was suggested to be associated with the separation and growth of micro-regions of a boron rich phase within the silica-iron oxide amorphous matrix. The activation energy for the extraction of boric oxide as a function of the leaching temperature was found to be equal to 7.99 ± 0.19 kcal/mole, whilst the activation energy for the extraction of iron oxide from air decomposed schorl was found to be equal to 7.13 ± 1.06 kcal/mole. The similarity between these values and that of 6.8 kcal/mole for the activation energy oftacTid leaching of phase-separated borosilicate glass (138), was thought to provide further indirect evidence for the suggestion that the amorphous phase in decomposed schorl contains phase separated micro-regions. The rate of extraction of both boric oxide and iron from schorl decomposed in reducing conditions was found to be considerably faster than from air decomposed schorl. This increased extractability was thought to be connected with the presence of micro-crystals of iron in the decomposed reduced schorl. The boric oxide present in both schorl and dravlte was found to be extractable if water vapour was passed over the decomposed minerals at temperatures above 1000*c. The activation energy for the extraction of boric oxide by pyrohydrolysis from decomposed schorl was found to be equal to 85 ± 8 kcal/mole, whilst the activation energy for the extraction of boric oxide by pyrohydrolysis from both decomposed dravite and "pyrex" glass was found to be equal to 22 ±1 kcal/mole. The higher value was thought to be due to the incorporation of Fe2+ ions into the amorphous silica lattice in decomposed schorl. This process was suggested to lead to an increase in the energy barrier towards the diffusion of water vapour through the silica-iron oxide amorphous matrix to the boron rich reaction surface.},

	abstract = {Data returned from Martian missions have revealed a wide diversity of surface mineralogies, including in geological structures interpreted to be sedimentary or altered by liquid water. These terrains are of great interest because of their potential to document the environment at a time when life may have appeared. Intriguingly, Martian sedimentary rocks show distinctly low thermal inertia values (i.e. 300 - 700 Jm−2K−1s−1/2, indicative of a combination of low thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and density). These low values are difficult to reconcile with their competent bedrock morphologies, whereas hundreds of bedrock occurrences, interpreted as volcanic in origin, have been mapped globally and display thermal inertia values {\textbackslash}textgreater 1200 Jm−2K−1s−1/2. Bedrock thermal inertia values are generally assumed to be driven by their bulk thermal conductivity, which in turn is controlled by their micro- and macro-physical properties (i.e., degree and style of cementation in the case of detritic rocks, horizontal fractures and layering, etc.), and not by their density (well-known from terrestrial analog measurements, and with modest variability) or specific heat capacity (generally uncharacterized for non-basaltic materials below room temperature). In this paper, we demonstrate that specific heat capacity cannot be a potential cause for the differential thermophysical behavior between magmatic and sedimentary rocks through a series of experimental Cp(T) measurements at 100–350 K using differential scanning calorimetry. The results on 20 Martian-relevant minerals investigated in this work indicate that these materials exhibit very similar specific heats, ranging from 0.3–0.7 Jg−1K−1 at 100 K to 0.6–1.7 Jg−1K−1 at 350 K. When used in a Martian thermal model, this range of Cp values translate to very small surface temperature differences, indicating that uncertainty in composition (and its effect on the specific heat) is not a noticeable source of thermal inertia variability for indurated units on Mars. We therefore conclude that the low thermal inertia value of sedimentary rocks compared to magmatic/volcanic rocks is likely due to their low apparent bulk conductivity, which bears information on their internal physical structure. Future work combining the analysis of thermal observations acquired at various local times and seasons will help further characterize this heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {In this work, five Mg-silicate glasses with compositions between MgSiO{\textbackslash}\_3{\textbackslash}and Mg{\textbackslash}\_2{\textbackslash}SiO{\textbackslash}\_4{\textbackslash}were synthesized by aerodynamic levitation combined with laser melting. Low-temperature heat capacity ({\textbackslash}C\_p{\textbackslash}) was measured (by relaxation calorimetry in the range 2–310 K) for all of them, with the resulting vibrational entropies at T = 298.15 K: sample MG50 with composition Mg{\textbackslash}\_\{0.996\}{\textbackslash}SiO{\textbackslash}\_\{2.996\}{\textbackslash}and entropy 72.88 J mol{\textbackslash}ˆ\{-1\}{\textbackslash}K{\textbackslash}ˆ\{-1\}{\textbackslash}; MG54 Mg{\textbackslash}\_\{1.174\}{\textbackslash}SiO{\textbackslash}\_\{3.174\}{\textbackslash}78.54; MG58 Mg{\textbackslash}\_\{1.364\}{\textbackslash}SiO{\textbackslash}\_\{3.364\}{\textbackslash}85.05; MG62 Mg{\textbackslash}\_\{1.611\}{\textbackslash}SiO{\textbackslash}\_\{3.611\}{\textbackslash}91.40; and MG67 Mg{\textbackslash}\_\{1.907\}{\textbackslash}SiO{\textbackslash}\_\{3.907\}{\textbackslash}102.75. Heat capacity of the glasses is higher than that of the corresponding crystal mixtures below 200 K but plunges below the C{\textbackslash}\_\{p,{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{crystal\}\}{\textbackslash}at higher temperatures. High-temperature {\textbackslash}C\_p{\textbackslash}was measured (by differential scanning calorimetry in the range 300–970 K) for MG50 and MG67 up to \{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox {\textbackslash}1000 K. Using our {\textbackslash}C\_p{\textbackslash}data, selected data for entropies of fusion, {\textbackslash}C\_p{\textbackslash}of crystals, and fictive temperatures, the configurational entropy ({\textbackslash}S\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{conf\}{\textbackslash}) at glass transition temperature ({\textbackslash}T\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{g\}{\textbackslash}) were calculated. For the near-forsterite glass MG67, the {\textbackslash}S\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{conf\}{\textbackslash}is 1.9 J mol{\textbackslash}ˆ\{-1\}{\textbackslash}K{\textbackslash}ˆ\{-1\}{\textbackslash}at {\textbackslash}T\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{g\}{\textbackslash}= 1040 K. As this small value is a difference of several large numbers, its uncertainty is relatively high; we consider a conservative estimate of 15 J mol{\textbackslash}ˆ\{-1\}{\textbackslash}K{\textbackslash}ˆ\{-1\}{\textbackslash}. Using the expression \{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}textbackslashlog {\textbackslash}textbackslasheta = A + B/[T S\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{conf\}(T)]{\textbackslash}, the available experimental viscosities (\{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}textbackslasheta {\textbackslash}) and the temperature-dependent configurational entropy from our work, we refined the parameters {\textbackslash}A = -2.34{\textbackslash}and {\textbackslash}B = 76,500{\textbackslash}for this equation, with {\textbackslash}S\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{conf\} (T) = 1.90+(83.7 {\textbackslash}textbackslashln (T/1040)){\textbackslash}. The configurational entropy for the enstatitic MG50 glass is 16.8 J mol{\textbackslash}ˆ\{-1\}{\textbackslash}K{\textbackslash}ˆ\{-1\}{\textbackslash}at {\textbackslash}T\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{g\}{\textbackslash}= 1063 K. The presented data can be combined with enthalpies of formation and thermophysical properties of Mg-silicate glasses for models that could elucidate geological and geophysical observations in the crust and mantle of the Earth.},

Phase relations in the system K2O-Al2O3-SiO2 are calculated using PerplEx and confirm a substantial stability field for kyanite-stishovite/coesite-K2Si4O9 wadeite intervening between KAlSi3O8 hollandite and sanidine. The calculated phase equilibria are in general agreement with experimental studies. The entropy and enthalpy of formation for KAlSi3O8H2O K-cymrite are slightly modified to better fit the Holland \& Powell (1998) data base and the previous experimental runs. Thermodynamic calculations are undertaken on the reaction of K-cymrite to KAlSi3O8 hollandite + H2O, which is located at 8.3-10.0 GPa for the temperature range 800-1600 K, well inside the stability field of stishovite. The decomposition reaction of muscovite to KAlSi3O8 hollandite + Al2O3 + H2O is placed at 10.0-10.6 GPa for the temperature range 900-1500 K, in reasonable agreement with some but not all experiments on this reaction. These reactions strongly support that KAlSi3O8 hollandite is an important K-bearing mineral down to depths of 400-660 km in the transition zone of the Earth's mantle.},

	abstract = {Molar enthalpies of formation of natural, near end-member tremolite and talc have been calculated from high temperature lead borate drop-solution calorimetry. Using three mutually consistent reaction cycles for each phase, the critical volatile component H 2 O was treated in fundamentally different ways, namely as the simple “oxide” [i.e., as the enthalpy difference (H TCal - H 298.15 ) only], or as the (OH)-component in both low and high water-content phases, respectively. The molar enthalpies of drop solution of all solid phases participating in the various reaction cycles (brucite, diopside, enstatite, calcite, magnesite, quartz) were independently measured. We corroborate that the dynamic gas flow techniques introduced by Navrotsky et al. (1994) are critically important for very hydrous phases such as brucite, but that this dynamic technique yields the same results as traditional static drop-solution techniques for phases with relatively lower water contents such as tremolite and talc. When these critical differences in H 2 O behavior are taken into account, it can be shown that drop-solution measurements on tremolite and talc over the last twenty years actually lead to similar and consistent results on the enthalpy of formation of these phases; reported differences are due to incorrect assumptions on the final state of H 2 O. Our refined values for the enthalpy of formation from the elements for ideal end-member tremolite and talc range from -12299.2 to -12308.9 kJ/mol and -5892.1 to -5900.2 kJ/mol, respectively, depending on the internally consistent data set used for the reaction cycle components. These values are identical within error to the results refined from various phase-equilibrium experiments and show that these two fundamentally different techniques can lead to a consistent picture on the thermodynamic properties of hydrous minerals, a conclusion that has been strongly questioned in the past. Heat capacity data have been obtained for the same samples of tremolite and talc by differential scanning calorimetry in step-scanning mode in the range 50-500 °C and 50-400 °C, respectively. The following best-fit equations apply to the ideal end-members [T in Kelvin, C P in in J/(mol · K)] in the range 298.15 to 800 K and 298.15 to 650 K, respectively: C P (tremolite) = 1335.77586 - 0.02378 T - 1.00400 10 7 T -2 - 9678.23152 T -0.5 . C P (talc) = 1300.66304 - 0.03007 T - 1.31510 10 7 T -2 - 8778.5468 T -0.5 .},

	abstract = {The shock Hugoniot is a fundamental relationship between pressure, volume, and energy for a given medium. Accurate knowledge of the Hugoniot for a material is critical in order to determine its response to shock waves and high-velocity impacts. Traditionally, the shock Hugoniot is measured on a point-bypoint basis by a series of high-velocity impact experiments. Observations are typically conﬁned to pointwise pressure or velocity measurements at the free-surfaces of the sample. In this work, shock waves are initiated in transparent polyurethane and semi-opaque polyurea samples using exploding bridgewires, aluminum ballistic projectiles, and gram-scale explosive charges. Shock waves and material motion are observed optically by shadowgraphy using a high-speed-digital camera recording at up to 106 frames/s. Ballistic impact, producing a constant-strength shock wave, is combined with these optical techniques to obtain a single shock Hugoniot point per test. A gram-scale explosive charge produces a shock wave in the material sample that is initially strong, but attenuates to near the bulk sound speed as it transits the polymer sample. With optical access to the entire sample, multiple shock and particle velocity combinations may be observed in a single test, allowing the measurement of a shock Hugoniot curve in fewer experiments than by traditional methods. These techniques produce data in general agreement with an extrapolation of published Hugoniot data for polyurethane and polyurea.},

	abstract = {Brittle deformation at high strain rates results in intense fragmentation and rock pulverisation. For rocks, the critical strain rate at which this behaviour occurs is {\textasciitilde}102 s−1. The mechanical properties of rocks at these strain rates can also be very different from their quasi-static properties. Deformation of rocks at these strain rates can occur during fault rupture, landslide events, and meteorite impacts. In this study, we present the results of high strain rate mechanical tests to determine the characteristic strain rate for rate-dependent brittle failure, and the fragment size and shape distributions that result from failure at these conditions. We investigated sandstone, quartzite, limestone, and marble and considered whether the fragment characteristics can be used as diagnostic indicators of loading conditions during brittle failure. We find that the characteristic strain rates, where the dynamic strength is twice the quasi-static strength, range between {\textasciitilde}150 and 300 s−1 for rate-dependent brittle failure in the investigated lithologies. Furthermore, we use our results to demonstrate an empirical inverse power-law relationship between fragment size and strain rate for dynamic failure under uniaxial compression. On the other hand, we show that fragment shape is independent of strain rate under dynamic uniaxial loading.},

A special inverse testing method suitable for rock targets was applied together with a laser interferometer for the measurement of the free-surface velocity of the target plate required for the calculation of the particle velocity (up) and the shock wave velocity (US) in the sandstone specimen. In our measurement range (impact velocity between about 50m/s and about 1300 m/s), the US – up data show significant scattering. The travel times of the impact-induced shock waves indicate that pore crushing occurs. A strong dependance of the US – up data on the test batch selected for the impact experiments and, thus, on the mining location was observed. This dependance is greater than the scattering of the individual data sets.},

	abstract = {Impact-generated shock waves can change the physical properties of meteorites and their constituent minerals. Accounting for these effects is key to recovering information about the early solar system from meteorite observations. ALH 84001 is a rare ancient sample from the Martian crust, providing a unique window into the thermal and metamorphic evolution of Mars. A well-studied meteorite, past geochemical and petrologic investigations have attempted to deduce its thermal and impact history with some contradictory results. By simulating the passage of a planar shock wave through a synthetic analog for samples of ALH 84001 using the iSALE-2D shock physics code we have determined the meteorite’s likely thermodynamic and physical response during an impact. Our simulations show that heterogeneous shear heating, induced by the planar shock wave, can produce strong thermal gradients on the sub-millimeter ‘mesoscale’ throughout the meteorite, even in relatively weak shock waves ({\textless}5GPa). We are able to place new constraints on deformation events experienced by the meteorite during its time on the parent body, including the maximum pressure ALH 84001 has experienced since it acquired its remanent magnetization and its subsequent ejection from Mars.},

Commonly, the shock wave is tracked thanks to pressure sensors and sometimes with a high-speed camera. In the present study, these methods were used to analyze the interaction of a shock wave with an obstacle of simple geometry. The primary aim of the study was to demonstrate the need to correlate these different methods in order to analyze certain phenomena related to the three-dimensional interaction of a shock wave with an object. The correlation between the overpressure and the visualization made it possible to carry out a complex analysis. The visualization was carried out simultaneously on two planes, from the front and top views, thanks to the optical setup. Shock wave characteristics were taken at ground level downstream of the obstacle with pressure gauges. The correlation of the images obtained allows the identification of the waves on the profile and their contribution in intensity.},

	abstract = {Rocky planets and moons experiencing solar wind sputtering are continuously supplying their enveloping exosphere with ejected neutral atoms. To understand the quantity and properties of the ejecta, well-established binary collision approximation Monte Carlo codes like TRIM with default settings are used predominantly. Improved models such as SDTrimSP have come forward, and together with new experimental data, the underlying assumptions have been challenged. We introduce a hybrid model, combining the previous surface binding approach with a new bulk binding model akin to Hofsäss \& Stegmaier. In addition, we expand the model implementation by distinguishing between free and bound components sourced from mineral compounds such as oxides or sulﬁdes. The use of oxides and sulﬁdes also enables the correct setting of the mass densities of minerals, which was previously limited to the manual setting of individual atomic densities of elements. All of the energies and densities used are thereby based on tabulated data, so that only minimal user input and no ﬁtting of parameters are required. We found unprecedented agreement between the newly implemented hybrid model and previously published sputter yields for incidence angles up to 45° from surface normal. Good agreement is found for the angular distribution of mass sputtered from enstatite MgSiO3 compared to the latest experimental data. Energy distributions recreate trends of experimental data of oxidized metals. Similar trends are to be expected from future mineral experimental data. The model thus serves its purpose of widespread applicability and ease of use for modelers of rocky body exospheres.},
